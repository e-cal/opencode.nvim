# opencode.nvim - Opencode <-> nvim sync

Simple nvim plugin to connect to opencode running in the same working directory and subscribe to its server-side events.

Currently just reloads the buffer when written to by opencode.

> Extremely stripped down version of [NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim](https://github.com/NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim). 
> If you're looking for a plugin to manage opencode entirely in nvim, that is the plugin you're looking for.
